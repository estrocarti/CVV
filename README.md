#House Price Prediction with Linear Regression
## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices using Linear Regression, a fundamental algorithm in machine learning for regression problems. The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict the price of a house based on various features like area, number of bedrooms, location, and more. This README outlines the project's motivation, the approach taken, the dataset used, and instructions on how to set up and run the model.
## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to simplify the process of estimating the market value of houses for both buyers and sellers. By analyzing historical data, we aim to provide a reliable and quick way to gauge house prices, which can aid in making informed decisions in the real estate market.

## Features
  * Data Preprocessing: Cleansing and preparing the dataset for training, including handling missing values and feature encoding.
  * Feature Selection: Analyzing and selecting relevant features that have the most impact on house prices.
  * Model Training and Testing: Utilizing Linear Regression to train the model and evaluate its performance on a test dataset.
  * Model Evaluation: Employing metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) to assess model 
      accuracy.

## Technologies Used

  * Python 3.x
  * Libraries: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical data on house sales, including features like the size of the house (in square feet), the number of bedrooms, location, and the price at which each house was sold.
